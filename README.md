This repository is a load balancer built using the http-proxy-middleware in Node.js.
operating on the round robin load balancing algorithm, requests are forwarded
to servers by a reverse proxy in a start from first server again when you reach 
last server format.

if there are 3 servers: 
server 1 gets request 1
server 2 gets request 2
server 3 gets request 3
server 1 gets request 4
server 2 gets request 5
server 3 gets request 6
